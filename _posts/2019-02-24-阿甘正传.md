[阿甘正传-豆瓣](https://movie.douban.com/subject/1292720/)

### Life was like a box of chocolates, you never know what you’re gonna get.

### Stupid is as stupid does.

### Miracles happen every day.

### I don’t know if we each have a destiny, or if we’re all just floating around accidental—like on a breeze. Maybe both get happening at the same time. 

### Death is just a part of life, something we’re all destined to do.

### You have got to put the past behind you before you can move on.

### If there is anything you need I will not be far away.

### I am a man of my word.

### There is an awful lot you can tell about a person by their shoes.

### There is only so much fortune a man really need and the rest is just for showing off.
